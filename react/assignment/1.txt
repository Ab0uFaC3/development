Theory:
1. What is Emmet?
- web developerâ€™s toolkit that can greatly improve your HTML & CSS workflow
- in simple terms, it is a shorthand technique that generates relevant and elaborate code
- increases the efficiency and saves time in typing the code
E.g.
    ul>li translates to <ul><li></li></ul>

2. Difference between a Library and Framework?
- both are reusable codes written by someone else providing abstraction
- Library: 
    * can be used anywhere in the code if not everywhere. 
    * gives control to developer over the flow of application
- Framework:
    * it takes control over the flow of the application
    * developer can still write their own code but cannot change the structuring of the application (fill in the blanks)
- main difference is the Inversion of Control (who has the control)

3. What is CDN? Why do we use it?
- Content Delivery Network
- they are servers used to cache the web content near to the user
- increases speed, performance, security (prevents against DDOS)

4. Why is React known as React?
- because it reacts only when there are changes in the component's state or props
- with its virtual DOM, React finds and updates only the necessary parts

5. What is crossorigin in script tag?
- used to enable CORS (Cross Origin Resource Sharing)
- helps in request resources from a different domain than the current
E.g.
    current domain => www.example.com
    requested domain => www.google.com
- if CORS is not enabled, requested domain cannot be loaded

6. What is diference between React and ReactDOM
- React: library for developing UI (irrespective of medium i.e. browser, mobile, etc)
- ReactDOM: library used for binding React components and browser DOM

7. What is difference between react.development.js and react.production.js files via CDN?
- react.development.js: provides developer friendly tools and environment
- react.production.js: used for increasing code efficiency and compression

8. What is async and defer?
- both are boolean attributes, used with <script> for loading external links
- Normal scenario: 
    if <script> is encountered during HTML parsing, browser halts the parsing, fetches the link and executes it in and resumes the parsing
- async attribute: 
    * if <script> is encountered during HTML parsing, browser continues the parsing and fetches the link simultaneously. 
    * once fetched, it halts the parsing, executes the link and resumes the parsing
    * does not guarantee order of execution of script
- defer attribute: 
    * if <script> is encountered during HTML parsing, browser continues the parsing and fetches the link simultaneously. 
    * once feteched, it executes the link once parsing is complete
    * does guarantee order of execution of script
